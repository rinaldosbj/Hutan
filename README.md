# Hutan
App Developed in the fist challenge after the onboarding (Camaragibe) at the Apple Developers Academy | UFPE

Hutan is an app that spreads pet information, it has two platforms the first is the pet guide there you can understand the basic care necessary for the care of a certain type of pet, so before you buy a new pet you are aware of the which is necessary, there is also the pet news platform that brings daily news from the pet world, so if you have read the entire guide you can always update yourself and learn more about your pet.

  "Hutan, information anywhere for those who want to take care!"
- The name Hutan comes from the Malay language and means Florest, so the Hutan guide truly is the Guide of the Florest, this word is also used in the name of an monkey specie called orangutan (Oran means Human), and our mascot Marco is an orangutan XD

It was such a fun experience, I've learned a lot in the Academy, here is some stuff I learned in while developing this app:
- Segues
- Timer
- Auto Layout
- WalkThrough
- Pet Caring

PS. I lost the last part of the code (I forgot to save, my last day of work :( but I recorded a video of it before making this mistake, I posted at my LinkedIn: Rinado da Silva Bento Junior), so I lost the code of the LaunchScrean and te WalkThrough, but the main part of the app (Hutan News and Hutan Guide) still there.

PS.2. I also coudn't upload the assets in a folder so it's mixed in with the content

Here is a sneak peek of the Hutan guide
